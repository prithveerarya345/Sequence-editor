# Sequence-editor
This web application was built using Flask and its function is to help manipulate biological sequences and perform pairwise alignment.

I made this application to aid me during my work while I do research for my bioinformatics course. I used the Biopython library to carry out the BLASTn search and parse the output. I included some additional tools that can complement, reverse, and translate the sequences I input. 

Although it works as expected, there is still work to be done.
